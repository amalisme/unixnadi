      <div class="container content-width">
        <div class="post-content">
          
          <p>I had a sudden request from a customer yesterday to upgrade their vRealize Network Insight deployment. They were running version 6.9.0, which is way out of support life. The plan was to upgrade to the latest release (6.14.1) before eventually moving to version 9.0.1.0.</p>

          <p>This product has gone through several name changes over the years from vRealize Network Insight (vRNI) to Aria Operations for Networks, and now VCF Operations for Networks. Regardless of what it's called, the upgrade process remains similar.</p>

          <p>Here's the complete walkthrough of how I performed this upgrade using the Single-Click Offline Upgrade method.</p>

          <h2>Pre-Requisites</h2>

          <h3>Check Product Interoperability</h3>

          <p>As with any VMware upgrade, the first step is checking the <a href="https://interopmatrix.vmware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VMware Product Interoperability Matrix</a>. In this case, I verified compatibility with vCenter, ESXi, and Usage Meter. Everything checked out for upgrading to 6.14.1.</p>

          <h3>Determine the Upgrade Path</h3>

          <p>Here's where it gets interesting. You can't jump directly from 6.9.0 to 6.14.1. VMware doesn't support that upgrade path. After checking the documentation, I found the required upgrade path:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>6.9.0 → 6.11.0</strong> (first hop)</li>
            <li><strong>6.11.0 → 6.13.0</strong> (second hop)</li>
            <li><strong>6.13.0 → 6.14.1</strong> (final destination)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>This means three separate upgrade cycles. I decided to upgrade to 6.11.0 first, let it run for a day to collect data and verify that the platform and collectors were working as intended, then continue with the remaining upgrades.</p>

          <h3>Download the ISO Files</h3>

          <p>Download all the required ISO files from the <a href="https://support.broadcom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Broadcom Support Portal</a>. You'll need the ISOs for versions 6.11.0, 6.13.0, and 6.14.1.</p>

          <h3>Backup Your Deployment</h3>

          <p>Before touching anything, back up your vRNI deployment. In my case, the customer didn't have backup configured, so I performed a cold snapshot of both the platform and collector VMs. Shut them down gracefully, take the snapshots, then power them back on.</p>

          <h3>Prepare the License</h3>

          <p>I generated a new license in advance, though the upgrade process didn't actually prompt for it. Still, it's good to have it ready just in case.</p>

          <h3>Check File System Usage</h3>

          <p>Make sure you have sufficient free space for the upgrade. Here are the requirements:</p>

          <p><strong>Platform (Node 1 only):</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>/</code> — 8GB free space</li>
            <li><code>/var</code> — 40GB free space</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Platform and Collector servers:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>/tmp</code> — 1GB free space</li>
            <li><code>/home</code> — 5GB free space</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Change UI Timeout</h3>

          <p>The KB <a href="https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/aria/aria-operations-for-networks/6-10/vrealize-network-insight-installation-6-10/upgrading-vrealize-network-insight/single-click-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> suggests changing the UI timeout to 2 hours, but I set it to 4 hours. Better safe than sorry. You don't want the session timing out in the middle of an upgrade.</p>

          <h3>Verify Platform and Collector Status</h3>

          <p>Make sure both the Platform server and Collector server are online. If you took cold snapshots like I did, remember to power the servers back on before proceeding.</p>

          <h3>Record Current Values</h3>

          <p>Before upgrading, jot down these values from the UI for comparison after the upgrade:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Count of VMs</li>
            <li>VMs where snapshot count > 0</li>
            <li>Count of Firewall Rules</li>
            <li>Count of Security Groups</li>
            <li>Count of NSX Firewalls</li>
          </ul>

          <p>You can find all this information by clicking through the UI. This helps verify that data wasn't lost during the upgrade.</p>

          <h2>Upgrade Process</h2>

          <p>I followed the <a href="https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/aria/aria-operations-for-networks/6-10/vrealize-network-insight-installation-6-10/upgrading-vrealize-network-insight/single-click-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Single-Click Offline Upgrade documentation</a> from Broadcom. Here's how it went.</p>

          <h3>Step 1: Navigate to Offline Upgrade</h3>

          <p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> → <strong>Infrastructure and Support</strong>. Under the Product section, you'll see the Software Version, Online Update toggle, and Offline Update option. Click on <strong>Click Here</strong> beside Offline Upgrade.</p>

          <img src="/images/vrni-upgrade-offline-click.webp" alt="vRNI Settings page showing Infrastructure and Support section with Offline Upgrade option" loading="lazy">

          <h3>Step 2: Upload the ISO</h3>

          <p>Browse and select the ISO file for version 6.11.0. The upload will take some time depending on your connection speed.</p>

          <img src="/images/vrni-upgrade-browse-iso.webp" alt="vRNI file browser dialog for selecting upgrade ISO" loading="lazy">

          <p>Wait for the upload to complete. You'll see a progress indicator.</p>

          <img src="/images/vrni-upgrade-upload-progress.webp" alt="vRNI showing ISO upload progress" loading="lazy">

          <h3>Step 3: Start the Upgrade</h3>

          <p>Once the upload is complete, the status will show as available. Click <strong>View Details</strong> to start the upgrade process.</p>

          <img src="/images/vrni-upgrade-upload-complete.webp" alt="vRNI showing upload complete with View Details button" loading="lazy">

          <p>A popup window will appear showing the build number, information about what will happen during the upgrade, and a checkbox to proceed. Tick the checkbox and click <strong>Confirm</strong>.</p>

          <img src="/images/vrni-upgrade-confirm.webp" alt="vRNI upgrade confirmation dialog with build information and checkbox" loading="lazy">

          <h3>Step 4: Pre-Check</h3>

          <p>A new popup shows the pre-check status. Review any warnings or issues, then click <strong>Install Now</strong> to proceed.</p>

          <img src="/images/vrni-upgrade-precheck.webp" alt="vRNI pre-check status screen with Install Now button" loading="lazy">

          <h3>Step 5: Upgrade in Progress</h3>

          <p>And here's the main event, the upgrade begins. This is why we changed the UI timeout earlier. You don't want the upgrade to be interrupted, and I didn't want to find out what happens if the session times out mid-upgrade.</p>

          <img src="/images/vrni-upgrade-in-progress.webp" alt="vRNI showing upgrade in progress" loading="lazy">

          <p>You can monitor the progress as the system upgrades various services.</p>

          <!-- <img src="/images/vrni-upgrade-services.webp" alt="vRNI showing services being upgraded" loading="lazy"> -->

          <h3>Step 6: Upgrade Complete</h3>

          <p>Once the upgrade finishes, you'll see a completion message. Click <strong>Done</strong>.</p>

          <img src="/images/vrni-upgrade-complete.webp" alt="vRNI upgrade complete dialog with Done button" loading="lazy">

          <h3>Step 7: Verify the Upgrade</h3>

          <p>After clicking Done, you'll be redirected to the login page; now with the new interface.</p>

          <img src="/images/vrni-upgrade-login-new.webp" alt="vRNI new login interface after upgrade" loading="lazy">

          <p>Log in and verify the installed version. Compare the values you recorded earlier (VM count, firewall rules, security groups, etc.) to ensure everything came through correctly.</p>

          <h2>Rinse and Repeat</h2>

          <p>Since we can't jump directly to 6.14.1, you'll need to repeat the same process for each upgrade hop:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Upload the 6.13.0 ISO and upgrade</li>
            <li>Upload the 6.14.1 ISO and upgrade</li>
          </ul>

          <p>I recommend letting the system run for at least a few hours (ideally a day) between upgrades to verify data collection is working properly.</p>

          <p>After completing all three upgrade cycles, here's my customer's final version:</p>

          <img src="/images/vrni-upgrade-final-version.webp" alt="vRNI showing final upgraded version 6.14.1" loading="lazy">

          <p>Notice that they have removed the Online Upgrade toggle.</p>
          
          <h2>Wrapping Up</h2>

          <p>Upgrading vRealize Network Insight across multiple versions takes patience, but the single-click offline method makes each individual upgrade straightforward. The key things to remember:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Check the upgrade path — you may need multiple hops</li>
            <li>Always backup before upgrading (snapshots work in a pinch)</li>
            <li>Verify file system space requirements</li>
            <li>Increase the UI timeout to avoid session interruptions</li>
            <li>Record key metrics before and after for verification</li>
          </ul>

          <p>I hope you find this guide helpful. If you need assistance with your vRNI upgrade or have questions, feel free to reach out. I'd also love to hear about your experience upgrading vRNI to Aria Operations for Networks (or VCF Operations for Networks, as it's now called).</p>
